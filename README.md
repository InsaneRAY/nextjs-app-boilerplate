# Intro
This boiler project is based on [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), it demonstrates the best practices regarding the following:
1. Folder structure
2. Shared logic between server side and client side
3. Style management with CSS frameworks like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) or [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
4. Custom server with [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)

Every folder has an `README` file that indicates everything underneath.
